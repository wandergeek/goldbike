## GoldBike -- Bike Rave 2019

This is a repo for some shit code very slightly modified from the standard FastLED colorpalette demo. 

The controller is a Pro Micro and kind of dicky to program to sometimes. Follow this hook up guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all#installing-mac--linux

I've also included some cool demos I've run across. Would like to incorporate these into the real deal.

### IMPORTANT
When programming the board, ensure the board is plugged into power first and then plug in your laptop. The strips are dense and draw a fuckload of current-- you don't want that coming from your lappy's usb port.
